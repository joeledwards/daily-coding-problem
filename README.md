My solutions to daily coding problems.

## Setup and Tests

You will Node.js (I recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md)).

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```shell
$ npm i
```

Then you can run the tests:

```shell
$ npm t
```

Or an individual test:

```shell
$ npx tap days/2019-04-23/test.js
```
